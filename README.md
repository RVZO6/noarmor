# NoArmor

A Minecraft plugin that adds a challenging twist to gameplay by penalizing players who wear armor.

## What it does

When players equip any piece of armor, they begin taking damage over time. This creates an interesting risk-reward dynamic where players must choose between protection and maintaining their health.

## Features

- **Health Drain**: Wearing armor causes gradual health loss
- **Real-time Feedback**: Players see a warning message when armor begins draining their health
- **Automatic Detection**: Works with all types of armor including helmets, chestplates, leggings, boots, and turtle shells

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the releases page
2. Place the JAR file in your server's `plugins` folder
3. Restart your server
4. The plugin will activate automatically

## Gameplay Impact

This plugin encourages players to:
- Rely on skill and positioning rather than armor
- Make strategic decisions about when to use armor
- Explore alternative strategies for survival

Perfect for servers looking to add a unique challenge to their gameplay!
